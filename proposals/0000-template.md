# Context
<mark>_**Context** if any, what is this project derived from? What if any
is it related to?_
</mark>

# Dependent Projects
<mark>_**Dependent Projects** if any, must be listed, and each dependent
project\'s maintainers must sign off on the proposal before it is

# Motivation
<mark>_**Motivation** for this project, a longer justification of the
project may be a couple of hundred words. Why is this project better
at solving a problem compared to parallel proposals or implemented
projects?_
</mark>

# Status
<mark>_**Status** of the project: See [project lifecycle](https://hyperledger.github.io/toc/project-lifecycle.html)._
</mark>

# Solution
<mark>_**Solution** to the problem addressed in the motivation section. Try
to make this as detailed as possible. The topics given below are
just suggestions, address only if they are relevant to your problem:_

-   _Transactions- including types, confidentiality, signing,
    traceability, identity of participants, contracts (scripts)_

-   _Effects on User facing Clients that help with transaction
    formation (similar to Wallets in BTC)_

-   _Effects on the network, throughput, visibility to other
    participants, change in protocol if any, criteria for network
    participation_

-   _Block formation and ledger formation: Consensus algorithm, size
    overhead, effects on the throughput and rate_

-   _Backward compatibility (hard fork or updates by all network
    participants needed?)_

-   _Rough design and scenarios on the probable effects, if any_

-   _The use of diagrams is encouraged to elucidate concepts_

-   _Address any possible objections and also support that came up
    during seed proposal from technical community on the lists._

-   _Traceability, testing criteria to gauge effects on installed
    base._

-   _License of codebase (including dependencies)_

-   _Any trademarks used in the project name or codebase?_
